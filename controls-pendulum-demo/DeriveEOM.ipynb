    "#### States\n",
    "\n",
    "The states of a system are variables that can be used to describe the behavior of a system. For a rocket, the states can include the following:\n",
    " - Position variables ($x$, $y$, $z$)\n",
    " - Orientation variables ($\\psi$, $\\theta$, $\\phi$)\n",
    " - Translational velocities ($\\dot{x}$, $\\dot{y}$, $\\dot{z}$) \n",
    " - Translational accelerations ($\\ddot{x}$, $\\ddot{y}$, $\\ddot{z}$)\n",
    " - Angular velocities ($\\dot{\\psi}$, $\\dot{\\theta}$, $\\dot{\\phi}$)\n",
    " - Angular accelerations ($\\ddot{\\psi}$, $\\ddot{\\theta}$, $\\ddot{\\phi}$)\n",

    "The linear state space model represents a dynamic system in a linear fashion. A dynamic system is where the next state is determined by its current state. Essentially, these are systems that evolve with time.\n",
